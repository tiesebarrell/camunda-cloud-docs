# Camunda Cloud Documentation

This repository contains the sources of the Camunda Cloud Documentation. The framework used for this is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Running the documentation locally

Change to the `website` directory and run `npm run start`:

```bash
cd website
npm run start
```

You can now browse the docs under [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Docusaurus will automatically detect when you change a file and refresh the page in the browser.

## Publishing

Creating a new tag with semver (`x.x.x`) will start a github action that builds and publishes the documentation.

Locally you can use the following command as well:

```bash
cd website
GIT_USER=${user} CURRENT_BRANCH=master USE_SSH=true npm run publish-gh-pages
```

## Writing docs

There are two places to consider:

1. The documentation itself is located in the `docs` directory.
2. The framework in the folder `website`.

### Documentation

- All Markdown files are located in the `docs` folder. Each markdown file has a header, which contains an ID and a title.
- Images or other files are stored in the folder `docs/assets`.

### Framework

- Structure of the documentation: [website/sidebars.json](./website/sidebars.json)
- Starting page: [website/pages/en/index.js](./website/pages/en/index.js)
- Help: [website/pages/en/help.js](./website/pages/en/help.js)
- Users: [website/pages/en/users.js](./website/pages/en/users.js)
- Footer: [website/core/footer.js](./website/core/footer.js)
